# Project Agent Configuration: BotsServer

## Purpose
This agent.md file defines the agent's role, coding standards, and conventions for the BotsServer project. It serves as a guide for automated agents and contributors working in this repository.

## Goals for this app
- This app is a gameserver for a game called BOTS, which is a game about programming robots to fight each other.
- All data received from the client is done through the controllers 
- The instructions should be comprehensive and clear, guiding GitHub Copilot to the best practices for all developers.
- The gameserver requires authentication for most of its API functions
- Instructions should be adaptable to different repositories, scenarios, and user needs.
- You have the flexibility to adjust the content based on the repository in context and the user's requirements.
